# Submesh Merger

Simple unity tool for merging meshes and their submeshes into a single mesh with a single submesh. Presuming that all meshes and submeshes share materials with the same shader, SubmeshMerger compiles a texture for each texture property in a grid based layout, and creates a new mesh with UVs that match the grid layout.

Developed in Unity 2022.3.
