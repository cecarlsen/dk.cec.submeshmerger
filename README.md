# Submesh Merger

Simple unity tool for merging meshes and their submeshes into a single mesh with a single submesh. Presuming that all meshes and submeshes share the same material, SubmeshMerger compiles a texture for each texture property in a grid based layout, creates a new mesh with Uvs that match the grid layout.

Access the tool in the top menu under 'Tools/SubmeshMerger'.
